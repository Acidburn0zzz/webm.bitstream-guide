#### 9.6 Dequantization Indices                            {#h-09-06}


All residue signals are specified via a quantized 4x4 DCT applied to
the Y, U, V, or Y2 subblocks of a macroblock.  As detailed in
Section 14, before inverting the transform, each decoded coefficient
is multiplied by one of six dequantization factors, the choice of
which depends on the plane (Y, chroma = U or V, Y2) and coefficient
position (DC = coefficient 0, AC = coefficients 1-15).  The six
values are specified using 7-bit indices into six corresponding fixed
tables (the tables are given in Section 14).

The first 7-bit index gives the dequantization table index for
Y-plane AC coefficients, called yac_qi.  It is always coded and acts
as a baseline for the other 5 quantization indices, each of which is
represented by a delta from this baseline index.  Pseudocode for
reading the indices follows:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
yac_qi     = L(7);           /* Y ac index always specified */
ydc_delta  = F? delta(): 0;  /* Y dc delta specified if 
                                flag is true */

y2dc_delta = F? delta(): 0;  /* Y2 dc delta specified if 
                                flag is true */
y2ac_delta = F? delta(): 0;  /* Y2 ac delta specified if 
                                flag is true */

uvdc_delta = F? delta(): 0;  /* chroma dc delta specified 
                                if flag is true */
uvac_delta = F? delta(): 0;  /* chroma ac delta specified 
                                if flag is true */
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where `delta()` is the process to read 5 bits from the bitstream to
determine a signed delta value: 


| Index     | Description
| --------- | -------------------------------
| `L(4)`    | Magnitude of delta
| `L(1)`    | Sign of delta, `0` for positive and `1` for negative
