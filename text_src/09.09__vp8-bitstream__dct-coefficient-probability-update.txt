#### 9.9 DCT Coefficient Probability Update                  {#h-09-09}


Contains a partial update of the probability tables used to decode DCT coefficients. These tables are maintained across interframes but are of course replaced with their defaults at the beginning of every key frame.

The layout and semantics of this field will be taken up in Chapter 13.
