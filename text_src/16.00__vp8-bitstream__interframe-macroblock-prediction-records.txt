### Section 16: Interframe Macroblock Prediction Records   {#h-16-00}


We describe the layout and semantics of the prediction records for macroblocks in an interframe.

After the feature specification (which is described in Section 10 and
is identical for intraframes and interframes), there comes a
Bool(prob_intra), which indicates inter-prediction (i.e., prediction
from prior frames) when true and intra-prediction (i.e., prediction
from already-coded portions of the current frame) when false.  The
zero-probability `prob_intra` is set by field J of the frame header.
