### Section 18: Interframe Prediction                      {#h-18-00}


Given an inter-prediction specification for the current macroblock,
that is, a reference frame together with a motion vector for each of
the sixteen Y subblocks, we describe the calculation of the
prediction buffer for the macroblock.  Frame reconstruction is then
completed via the previously described processes of residue summation
(Section 14) and loop filtering (Section 15).

The management of inter-predicted subblocks and sub-pixel
interpolation may be found in the reference decoder file `predict.c`
(Section 20.14).
