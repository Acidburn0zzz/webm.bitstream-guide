### Section 9: Frame Header                                {#h-09-00}

The uncompressed data chunk at the start of each frame and at the
first part of the first data partition contains information
pertaining to the frame as a whole.  We list the fields in the order
of occurrence.  Most of the header decoding occurs in the reference
decoder file `dixie.c` (Section 20.4).
