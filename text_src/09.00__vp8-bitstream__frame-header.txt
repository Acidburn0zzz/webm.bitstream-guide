### Chapter 9: Frame Header

The uncompressed data chunk at the start of each frame and the first part of the first data partition contains information pertaining to the frame as a whole. We list the fields in the order of occurrence, giving details for some of the fields. Other details are postponed until a more logical point in our overall description. Most of the header decoding occurs in the reference decoder file `decodeframe.c`.
