#### 9.9 DCT Coefficient Probability Update                {#h-09-09}


This field contains updates to the probability tables used to decode
DCT coefficients.  For each of the probabilities in the tables, there
is an `L(1)` flag indicating if the probability is updated for the
current frame, and if the `L(1)` flag is set to `1`, there follows an
additional 8-bit value representing the new probability value.  These
tables are maintained across interframes but are of course replaced
with their defaults at the beginning of every key frame.

The layout and semantics of this field will be taken up in
Section 13.
