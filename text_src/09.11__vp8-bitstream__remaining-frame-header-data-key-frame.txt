#### 9.11 Remaining Frame Header Data (Key Frame)          {#h-09-11}


| Index        | Description
| ------------ | ------------- 
| `L(1)`       | `mb_no_skip_coeff`. This flag indicates at the frame level if skipping of macroblocks with no non-zero coefficients is enabled.  If it is set to `0`, then `prob_skip_false` is not read and `mb_skip_coeff` is forced to `0` for all macroblocks (see Sections 11.1 and 12.1).
| `L(8)`       | `prob_skip_false` = Probability used for decoding a macroblock-level flag, which indicates if a macroblock has any non-zero coefficients.  Only read if `mb_no_skip_coeff` is `1`.


Decoding of this portion of the frame header is handled in the reference decoder file `modemv.c` (Section 20.11).

This completes the layout of the frame header.  The remainder of the
first data partition consists of macroblock-level prediction data.

After the frame header is processed, all probabilities needed to
decode the prediction and residue data are known and will not change
until the next frame.
