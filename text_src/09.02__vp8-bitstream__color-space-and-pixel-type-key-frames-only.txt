| Field  | Value
| ------ | ------------------------------- 
| `L(1)` | 1-bit color space type specification
| `L(1)` | 1-bit pixel value clamping specification


The color space type bit is encoded as the following:

  * `0` - YUV color space similar to the YCrCb color space defined in ITU-R BT.601
  * `1` - YUV color space whose digital conversion to RGB does not involve multiplication and division

It should be noted that in either case, the actual conversion between YUV and RGB is not part of this specification.

**Note: In the initial release of VP8 only color space type `0` is supported.**

The pixel value clamping type bit is encoded as the following:

  * `0` - Decoders are required to clamp the reconstructed pixel values to between `0` and `255` (inclusive).
  * `1` - Reconstructed pixel values are guaranteed to be between `0` and `255`, no clamping is necessary.

Information in this subsection does not appear in interframes.
