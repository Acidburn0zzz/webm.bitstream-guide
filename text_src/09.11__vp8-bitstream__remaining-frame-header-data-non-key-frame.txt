#### 9.10 Remaining Frame Header Data (Non-Key Frame)      {#h-09-10}


| Index     | Description
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- 
| `L(1)`    | `mb_no_skip_coeff`. This flag indicates at the frame level if skipping of macroblocks with no non-zero coefficients is enabled. If it is set to `0`, then `prob_skip_false` is not read and `mb_skip_coeff` is forced to `0` for all macroblocks (see Sections 11.1 and 12.1).
| `L(8)`    | `prob_skip_false` = probability used for decoding a macroblock-level flag, which indicates if a macroblock has any non-zero coefficients. Only read if `mb_no_skip_coeff` is `1`.
| `L(8)`    | `prob_intra` = probability that a macroblock is "intra" predicted (that is, predicted from the already-encoded portions of the current frame), as opposed to "inter" predicted (that is, predicted from the contents of a prior frame).
| `L(8)`    | `prob_last` = probability that an inter-predicted macroblock is predicted from the immediately previous frame, as opposed to the most recent golden frame or altref frame.
| `L(8)`    | `prob_gf` = probability that an inter-predicted macroblock is predicted from the most recent golden frame, as opposed to the altref frame.
| `F`       | If true, followed by four `L(8)`s updating the probabilities for the different types of intra-prediction for the Y plane.  These probabilities correspond to the four interior nodes of the decoding tree for intra-Y modes in an interframe, that is, the even positions in the `ymode_tree` array given above.
| `F`       | If true, followed by three `L(8)`s updating the probabilities for the different types of intra-prediction for the chroma planes.  These probabilities correspond to the even positions in the `uv_mode_tree` array given above.
| `X`       | Motion vector probability update.  Details are given in Section 17.2, "Probability Updates".


Decoding of this portion of the frame header is handled in the
reference decoder file `dixie.c` (Section 20.4).
