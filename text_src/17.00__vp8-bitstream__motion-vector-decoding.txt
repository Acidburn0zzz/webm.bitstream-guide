As discussed above, motion vectors appear in two places in the VP8
datastream: applied to whole macroblocks in `NEWMV` mode and applied to
subsets of macroblocks in `NEW4x4` mode.  The format of the vectors
is identical in both cases.

Each vector has two pieces: a vertical component (row) followed by a
horizontal component (column).  The row and column use separate
coding probabilities but are otherwise represented identically.
