README for VP8 Bitstream Guide
==============================

History
-------
June 2010 -- This document has had a very limited audience for most of 
its life.  As VP8 is now an open-source project, the document is 
expected to undergo very significant change.

Format
------
The complete document is composed of individual text files for each 
section, concatenated in filename order.

The text source is designed for transformation to HTML via Markdown [1], 
and uses the syntax extensions supported by PHP Markdown Extra [2].  
kramdown [3] also supports this syntax acceptably well; other Markdown 
transformers may not.  For example, python-markdown Extra [4] gets a few 
things wrong.

The source contains several blocks delimited with 
`<element markdown="1"></element>`, to handle special processing needs. 
The container is typically a <div>.

MathML
------
The text source also includes some block-level and span-level MathML 
expressions, written in ASCIIMathML syntax [5].  The standard delimiter 
for ASCIIMathML expressions is the backtick (`), which unfortunately is 
reserved by Markdown, so an alternate delimiter of double square 
brackets (plus one space) is used:

  This sentence includes a math expression, [[ sin^-1(x) ]],  
  delimited with double square brackets plus a one-space buffer.
