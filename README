README for VP8 Bitstream Guide
==============================

History (June 2010)
-------------------
This document has had a very limited audience for most of its life. 
As VP8 is now an open-source project, the document is expected to 
undergo very significant change.

Format (September 2010)
------
The complete document is composed of individual text files for each 
section, concatenated in filename order.

The text source is designed for transformation to HTML via Markdown [1], 
and uses the syntax extensions supported by PHP Markdown Extra [2] as 
implemented by kramdown [3].

kramdown 0.10.0 is the recommended text-to-HTML transformer. PDFs may be 
generated one-off using PrinceXML [4].

MathML
------
The text source also includes some block-level and span-level MathML 
expressions, written in ASCIIMathML syntax [5].  The standard delimiter 
for ASCIIMathML expressions is the backtick (`), which unfortunately is 
reserved by Markdown, so an alternate delimiter of double square 
brackets (plus one space) is used:

  This sentence includes a math expression, [[ sin^-1(x) ]],  
  delimited with double square brackets plus a one-space buffer.
